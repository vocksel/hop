# Hop for VS Code

Hop switches one VS Code window between your worktrees. Run **Hop: Go** to search every worktree Hop knows about by repository, branch, PR number (`flipbook#482`), or PR title, then switch to it in the same window. Each word narrows the results, and `default` matches a repository's default-branch checkout, so `flipbook default` finds it without naming the branch. A repository's default-branch checkout is listed first, then the most recently changed worktrees, judged by when Git last updated each index.

Each switch opens the checkout as the window's only workspace folder. VS Code reloads the window and its extensions when the folder changes.

`hop <expr>` in a terminal hands off to the extension through `vscode://vocksel.hop/to?path=…` and switches the most recently focused window.

Pull requests without a local worktree appear at the end of the list. Selecting one runs `hop to`, which switches to a worktree it finds after refreshing or checks the PR out into a new one. Every row with a PR has a button to open it in the browser. Pasting a PR URL (or typing `owner/repo#123`, `repo#123`, or `#123`) shows that PR's worktree, or a **Check out** row for a PR Hop has not seen. Other people's PRs that Hop has checked out, marked with their author, appear only for these references, never for search words.

## Install

```sh
npm ci
npm run package
code --install-extension hop.vsix
```

`npm run package` builds the `hop` CLI with Lute and bundles it into the extension. Set `hop.path` to use a different executable.

The extension has no runtime dependencies, sends no telemetry, and makes no network requests. GitHub data comes from `hop`, which uses your `gh` login.
