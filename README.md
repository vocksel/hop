# Hop

Hop joins local Cursor and Claude Code sessions to Git worktrees. It can list recent work, open the matching folder in VS Code, resume a Cursor session, or jump from a GitHub pull request to its worktree, checking the PR out first when needed.

## Install

Hop requires macOS, Git, the GitHub CLI, SQLite, VS Code's `code` launcher, and Cursor's `agent` launcher for the commands that use them.

```sh
rokit install
lute run install
lute setup
lute run build
```

The native executable is written to `build/hop`. To install a released version through Rokit:

```sh
rokit add --global vocksel/hop
```

## Commands

```text
hop <expr>
hop to <expr>
hop list [--refresh] [--no-pr] [--json]
hop recent [--limit N] [--repo OWNER/REPO] [--agent cursor|claude] [--json]
hop cursor [NUMBER|QUERY]
hop help [COMMAND]
```

Every command accepts `--help` (or `-h`) to describe its options.

`hop <expr>` is shorthand for `hop to <expr>`, which opens the matching worktree. With the [VS Code extension](vscode/README.md) installed, the most recently focused VS Code window switches to it in place; otherwise Hop runs `code <folder>`. An expression is a pull request reference (`owner/repo#123`, `repo#123`, `#123`, or a PR URL) or a query. Each word of a query must match a branch, repository, folder name, PR title, or `repo#123` of your own work, so `hop flipbook m` narrows `hop flipbook` and a bare `123` finds `flipbook#123`. The word `default` matches a checkout of the repository's default branch, as reported by `origin/HEAD` or else `main` or `master`, so `hop flipbook default` opens it without naming the branch. Ambiguous results use a numbered terminal picker that lists worktrees whose branch is exactly the query first, then the default-branch checkout of any repository named in the query, then the most recently changed worktrees, judged by when Git last updated each index. A PR reference resolves your work first and other people's second:

1. A worktree of yours for the PR opens directly.
2. Your open PR without a worktree is checked out beside your clone as `<folder>-pr-<number>`.
3. Someone else's PR that Hop checked out before opens directly, without asking GitHub.
4. Otherwise Hop looks the PR up once. If one of your worktrees is on its branch, that worktree opens. If not, the PR is checked out under `~/.hop/cache/worktrees/<owner>/<repo>-pr-<number>`, linked to your clone. When you have no clone, Hop makes a partial one in `~/.hop/cache/repos/<owner>/<repo>` first.

Other people's worktrees stay out of your list and searches; only a PR reference reaches them. Everything under `~/.hop/cache` is disposable, so deleting it is safe as long as you have pushed any work you did there. Hop fetches these PRs from `refs/pull/<number>/head` into a `pr-<number>` branch, so PRs that share a head branch never compete for one local branch. `repo#123` names a repository when exactly one of your clones or Hop's clones has that name.

`hop list` shows every discovered worktree with its associated pull request, open pull requests that have no local worktree, and other people's pull requests Hop has checked out. Results are cached in `~/.hop/cache/worktrees.json`. `--refresh` rediscovers worktrees and looks up each worktree's pull request by branch, plus your open pull requests in the same repositories, using concurrent batched GitHub queries. `hop to` refreshes the cache once before checking out a PR, when nothing matches, or when a cached match no longer exists, so a worktree or PR newer than the cache is found. `--no-pr` skips GitHub and does not update the cache, and neither does a refresh whose GitHub lookup fails. `--json` prints the same data for tools such as editor integrations.

`hop recent` merges active top-level Cursor sessions with Claude Code JSONL sessions and sorts them by last activity. Cursor metadata is queried from its SQLite database in read-only mode. If either provider is unavailable, Hop continues with the other provider.

`hop cursor` runs `agent --workspace <folder> --resume <composer-id>`.

## Configuration

Hop searches from the home directory by default. To narrow discovery, create `~/.hop/config.luau`:

```luau
return {
	roots = {
		"/path/to/source",
	},
}
```

Hop discovers primary Git repositories at most four directories below each root and asks each primary for its complete linked-worktree list. It does not follow symlinks, scans at most 200 primaries, and skips common large home-directory folders and dependency caches.

## Development

```sh
rokit install
lute run install
lute setup
lute run analyze
lute test
lute run build
```

Tests are colocated as `*.spec.luau`. Runtime subprocesses are routed through an injected command runner so adapters and CLI behavior can be tested without invoking local tools.
